## Introduction

In this lab, you'll dive into compiler design concepts by working with Lex and Makefile. These tools are fundamental for building compilers and automating build processes. The provided demo files and exercises will help you gain practical experience. The implementation of the last lab 11 includes things like symboltable, error handling for variable declaration(int,char ,double, float) , switch , while , for , if elseif ladder. 

## Contents

The repository includes:

- `demo_files`: Practical examples of Lex and Makefile usage. These examples are designed to give you insights into real-world application.

## Getting Started

### Understanding Makefile

Start by exploring the `Makefile` in the `demo_files` directory. This file illustrates how to automate the compilation process using Makefile commands. Take note of the targets, dependencies, and commands specified.

### Exploring Lex

Review the Lex files (`.l` files) in the `demo_files` directory. These files contain lexical specifications using regular expressions. Analyze the patterns and corresponding actions defined in these files. Lex is essential for generating lexical analyzers.

## Lab Exercises

Put your knowledge to the test with these lab exercises:

### Modify Lex Patterns

Select a Lex file from `demo_files` and experiment with modifying the regular expressions and actions. Observe the effects on tokenization. This exercise deepens your understanding of lexical analysis.

### Extend Lex Rules

Choose a language construct and extend the Lex file to handle additional cases. Define new patterns and actions to tokenize these cases accurately. This exercise reinforces your grasp of Lex's usage.

### Create Makefile Targets

Create a Makefile for a project (new or existing). Define targets like compilation, cleaning, and execution. This exercise enhances your ability to manage complex build processes.

## Conclusion

This README provides a roadmap for your Compiler Design Lab Work. As you work through the provided materials and exercises, you'll gain practical skills in compiler design, Lex, and Makefile. Feel free to refer back to this README as needed.
